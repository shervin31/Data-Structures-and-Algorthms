# 🖥️ EEK Course: Data Structures in C  

This repository contains my work and learning experiences from the **EEK Data Structures in C** course. Throughout the semester, I explored the fundamentals of C programming and built a strong foundation in various data structures and algorithms.  

The course started with an introduction to C programming concepts, including compiling and executing programs. I learned about program structure, syntax, data types, variables, operators, expressions, and flow control. These fundamentals allowed me to write efficient and structured programs.  

As the course progressed, I worked with **functions, pointers, arrays, and multi-dimensional arrays**, which are essential for handling data efficiently in C. I also learned about **strings** and **user-defined types** such as **structures, unions, and enumerations**, enabling me to organize complex data in a logical and manageable way. File I/O operations were another important topic, giving me the skills to read and write data from external files.  

A significant portion of the course was dedicated to **data structures**, where I implemented and analyzed various structures, including:

- **Linked Lists** – both single and double linked lists, allowing dynamic data storage and efficient insertion and deletion.  
- **Stacks and Queues** – fundamental structures for managing data in a last-in-first-out or first-in-first-out order, respectively.  
- **Trees** – including binary trees, binary search trees, AVL trees, red-black trees, and B-trees, which are crucial for hierarchical data organization and fast search operations.  
- **Hash Tables** – using hash functions to efficiently store and retrieve data while handling collisions.  
- **Heaps** – including binary heaps, binomial heaps, and Fibonacci heaps, which are useful for priority queues and efficient sorting.  
- **Graphs** – covering graph representations, operations, and algorithms such as minimum spanning tree problems, shortest path problems, and Dijkstra’s algorithm.  

Throughout the course, I completed assignments that reinforced these concepts, ranging from basic C programming tasks to implementing complex data structures and algorithms. I also practiced analyzing time and space complexity to evaluate the efficiency of my implementations.  

By the end of the course, I developed a comprehensive understanding of both **C programming** and **data structures**, as well as the ability to apply these skills to solve real-world computational problems. This experience has greatly strengthened my problem-solving, coding, and algorithmic thinking skills, preparing me for more advanced programming challenges.
